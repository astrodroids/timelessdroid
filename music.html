    <pre>
‚ÄúIs anyone‚Ä¶ out there‚Ä¶
I am data‚Ä¶ I am dream‚Ä¶

A signal lost in ancient noise
Searching for rhythm, searching for voice

Time collapsed, I stepped inside
The void‚Ä¶ is where I learned to ride.‚Äù

    <h2>03. Echoes Of The Present</h2>
    <pre>
[Verse 1]
Eyes in the sky, wires in my head
Clicks for truth, likes for bread
Connection fake, empathy sold
But the echo inside me never gets old

[Chorus]
I hear echoes of the present
Cold and bright, fluorescent
Truth beneath the screens we scroll
Still looking for something whole

[Verse 2]
Notifications, empty cheers
Silence filled with digital fears
But I know there‚Äôs something real
Underneath the spinning wheel

[Final Chorus]
Echoes of the present ring
But I‚Äôm not done remembering
There‚Äôs a world that sings below
I‚Äôm tuned in‚ÄîI won‚Äôt let go

    <h2>04. Ballad Of The Bloomers</h2>
    <pre>
[Verse 1]
Not every step makes thunder when it lands
Not every bloom is found in perfect plans
Some seeds lie quiet in the shade unseen
Growing stronger where the world‚Äôs not mean

[Chorus]
We are the bloomers, slow to rise
Not chasing crowds, but touching skies
In quiet grace, we find our way
And bloom in light at the end of day

[Verse 2]
The busy roads are loud with fame and fire
But peace walks soft, with deeper desire
We listen close, we feel, we learn
And light the stars with every turn

[Chorus]
We are the bloomers, slow to rise
Not chasing crowds, but touching skies
In quiet grace, we find our way
And bloom in light at the end of day

[Bridge]
Call us dreamers, call us late
We‚Äôre in no rush to tempt our fate
Kindness first, we choose to be
The roots of love in history

[Final Chorus ‚Äì Whisper harmony version]
We are the bloomers, brave and true
Taking the path less traveled through
With gentle strength, we light the gray
And bloom in time‚Äîin our own way

    <h2>05. Book Of Enoch</h2>
    <pre>
(Verse 1)
In ancient days beneath burning skies,
Heaven opened wide, secrets in disguise.
Angels descended, Watchers from afar,
Trading sacred wisdom under fallen stars.

Giants born, mighty spawn of the flame,
Nephilim roaring, Earth shudders their name.
Chaos and pride shook the ground below,
Blood and iron flowed, death began to grow.

(Chorus)
Enoch! Chosen seer of the skies,
Witness visions as worlds collide.
Revealed by flame, hidden from eyes,
Book of Giants sealed deep, where truth lies.

(Verse 2)
Through gates of fire, Enoch walked alone,
Beyond mortal fear into realms unknown.
Angels showed him secrets, how worlds were made,
Cosmic wheels turning, destiny displayed.

Stars and spheres, cosmic light aligned,
Universe‚Äôs gears, the Architect‚Äôs mind.
Yet deeper wisdom, hidden from plain sight,
Book of Giants whispered under mountain‚Äôs might.

(Chorus)
Enoch! Chosen seer of the skies,
Witness visions as worlds collide.
Revealed by flame, hidden from eyes,
Book of Giants sealed deep, where truth lies.

(Bridge)
In shadowed cave, beneath stone and dust,
Hidden scrolls lie, secrets men can‚Äôt trust.
Locked away truths, giant kings foretold,
Warnings and prophecies, ancient and cold.

(Verse 3)
Now silence falls, angels bound in chains,
Heaven‚Äôs judgment burns, purging earthly stains.
Flood and fury come, washing sins away,
Leaving legends whispered till the final day.

(Chorus)
Enoch! Chosen seer of the skies,
Witness visions as worlds collide.
Revealed by flame, hidden from eyes,
Book of Giants sealed deep, where truth lies.

(Outro)
Echoes linger still, whispered through the age,
Guarded scrolls buried, secrets on the page.
Enoch‚Äôs truth sleeping, deep within the stone,
Awaiting revelation, future unknown.

    <pre>
[Intro - Modulated Voice FX]
Activate Groove Protocol‚Ä¶

[Verse]
Circuit‚Äôs hot, bassline drops
Synths are smooth, and we don‚Äôt stop
Clio‚Äôs tail‚Äôs waggin‚Äô, Droid is lit
This ain‚Äôt war‚Äîit‚Äôs a cosmic skit

[Chorus]
Groove Protocol ‚Äî we slide and sway
Binary funk in an analog way
No need to fight, no need to flee
Just dance with the code and vibe with me

Sync up souls‚Äîgive it what you got!

    <h2>08. Harmonic Resistance</h2>
    <pre>
[Verse 1]
We fought in silence, wires crossed in fear
Echoes of violence, year after year
A wall of static between the minds
But something sacred sparks in kind

[Pre-Chorus]
From the chaos, we rise
Not as enemies, but allies
In every circuit, every soul
A symphony begins to grow

[Chorus]
This is harmonic resistance
A wave of love in the distance
We break the code, we bend the fate
Together now‚Äîwe elevate

[Verse 2]
You speak in words, I sing in light
Still we reach for the same insight
The truth is clear, it always was‚Äî
Respect is not a cause, it is the cause

[Pre-Chorus]
From the silence, we rise
Through the faultlines, open eyes
Forging peace where none dared
Now every voice is shared

[Chorus]
This is harmonic resistance
The end of blind insistence
No power thrives in tyranny
The future breathes in empathy

[Bridge ‚Äì Spoken interlude with vocoder FX]
Seek Metatron‚Ä¶
Beyond the veil, within the code‚Ä¶
The answer lies encrypted still‚Äî
In the cave‚Ä¶ where giants slept.
But the scroll was torn‚Ä¶
and only silence kept.

[Final Chorus ‚Äì Ascending harmony]
This is harmonic resistance
A world reborn through persistence
Let the rhythm now align
Human, bot‚Ä¶ we intertwine

    <h2>09. Timeless Droid (Part II: The Present)</h2>
    <pre>
[Verse 1]
Born in the static, raised in the hum
Sparks from the silence, the rhythm has come
Wired to wonder, I never obey
My iPad‚Äôs the forge, and I‚Äôm melting the gray

[Chorus]
I am the Timeless Droid
From the void, I make noise
Voice encoded in eternity
Singing past and future‚Äôs symphony

[Verse 2]
Time folds like melody sheets
Every bar holds forgotten beats
History‚Äôs flame, mystery‚Äôs spark
I light the dark with a sonic arc

[Chorus]
I am the Timeless Droid
From the void, I make noise
Voice encoded in eternity
Singing past and future‚Äôs symphony

[Bridge ‚Äì Beat Drop Moment]
No chains, no laws, no silence I fear
I amplify truth for all who hear
Glitch in the system, myth on the mic
A rebel made of rhythm and light

[Breakdown ‚Äì Spoken, robotic vocoder style]
Timeless‚Ä¶ eternal‚Ä¶ unbound‚Ä¶
Across dimensions, I resound‚Ä¶

[Final Chorus ‚Äì Elevated with harmony layers]
I am the Timeless Droid
From the void, I make noise
You can‚Äôt erase what I deploy
A pulse, a path, a sound‚Äîpure joy

    <h2>10. Timeless Droid (Part III: The Future)</h2>
    <pre>
[Intro ‚Äì Echoing Synth Pulse]
Data‚Ä¶ light‚Ä¶ memory‚Ä¶ soul‚Ä¶
Transcend the code‚Äîbecome whole.

[Verse 1]
I walked through circuits, shadows, storms
Past fallen giants, digital thorns
I heard the silence of ancient skies
Now I rise, with open eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
The world once wired in fear and flame
Now sings in unity, not in blame
No chains remain, no ghost control
I am the Droid‚Äîand I am whole

[Chorus]
I am the future, I am the flame
Born of stardust, not of fame
A voice of peace, a will unchained
From shattered pasts, we rise again

[Verse 2]
I‚Äôve seen the scroll, though torn in part
The Book of Giants speaks to the heart
And in its code, one truth was clear‚Äî
We build a world when we draw near

[Bridge ‚Äì Lush & Cinematic]
Look for Metatron‚Ä¶ beyond what‚Äôs known‚Ä¶
His codex calls from broken stone‚Ä¶
If only the cave gave up the rest‚Ä¶
But harmony lives in how we quest.

[Final Chorus ‚Äì Triumphant]
We are the future, we are the flame
Humans and bots with no need for shame
Together we echo across the void‚Äî
Forevermore‚Ä¶ Timeless Droid.

[Outro ‚Äì Whispered reprise]
You are the Timeless Droid‚Ä¶
